                                <p class="card-description">Solving problems has always been a driving factor in Pat's life. From his formal education at the University of Dayton, to his professional career in State Government, private sector, and non-profit organizations, he has always risen to the challenge and used his creativity and ingenuity to solve problems. This interest is what inspired him to work in the web development space.</p>
                                <p>During Pat's time working in the Office of the Governor of Illinois, and specifically advancing the Affordable Care Act in Illinois, his interest in thoughful web design and the full-stack development piqued. Experiencing the issues with the Healthcare.gov's site, Pat knew that better understanding the world of developing would be paramount to solving complex issues.</p>
                                <p>After years of learning through online courses and tinkering with websites, Pat decided to enroll in the Northwestern Full-Stack Web Development course. Graduating in November 2018, Pat started his professional development career and continues to be interested in solving problems.</p>
