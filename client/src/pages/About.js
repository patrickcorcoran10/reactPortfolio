                                <p class="card-description"> From a young age, Eric took interest in all things web development while spending countless hours at the family computer creating websites on just about any topic under the sun.  Early stage AOL templates served as his 'canvas'.  Although he chose to major in Psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and to drift somewhat from his passion, his desire to develop never faded.</p><p>In studying for his MBA during the fall of 2013, Eric completed a pre-requisite course in Management Informantion Systems under longtime IBM Consultant & DePaul University Professor, Dr. Sasha Deklava.  Here, Eric's passion for development found new life and his awareness of how it could benefit organizations was awakened.</p>  
                                <p>In pursuit of more formalized education on the topic, Eric enrolled in Northwestern Unversity's School of Professional Studies Full-Stack Web Development program in May of 2018.  Eric graduated with Full-Stack Certification in November of 2018.</p>
